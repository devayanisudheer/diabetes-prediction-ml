# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques.
It was developed as an academic project using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Saving the trained model

## Files in this Repository
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing full implementation
- `diabetes_model.pkl` – Trained machine learning model
- `Diabetes_Model_User_Manual.pdf` – Project documentation and usage guide

## Notes
- Dataset is not included in this repository.
- This project is for academic and learning purposes.
